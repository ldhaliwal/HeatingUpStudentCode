It's not going well. I don't think its going through the windows properly, so i need to find a way to fix that. |

| January 22 | 9:00-10:05 am |  Finished! i started out by implementing the basic recursive method we had talked about during the theory class, then had to do some moving things around in my main method to get everything to work. I was working with sierra to try and find a faster way to set up the adjacency list, but we couldn't figure that out. we also had some trouble remembering that we had to instantiate the Arraylists before we could loop through everything. Once everything was working I had to try to get my testEfficientLarge to not time out which was a stuggle, and I concluded that my computer is old and just needs to be plugged in 24/7 for anything to work well. Also for some reason i found that using Integer.max rather than Math.max was SIGNIFICANTLY faster. idk why but thats interesting. |
