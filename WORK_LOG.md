| January 13 |   2:30-3pm    | Started brainstorming, wrote a very simple nested for loop idea that actually passed 3/5 test cases, but i think i know why it failed the other ones. then I spent a good amount of time talking with everyone else about some ideas, we agreed that some sort of recursive search might work best, and then we thought of some ways to reduce runtime that involved going through the temperatures backwards and doing a sort of path compression thing, but we didn't totally understand what we were talking about or how to implement it. |

It's not going well. I don't think its going through the windows properly, so i need to find a way to fix that. |
